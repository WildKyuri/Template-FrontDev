# Working with Sass

## What about this :grey_question:

This template will help you working on little proyects with Sass, js and the target of having a good
performance in your web page. It works with Gulp having a gulpfile that
performs multiple task:

We have a folder with two gulpfiles

- With Browser-sync
- Without Browser-sync

### Sass

Compiles all Sass files into a single css file, at the same time with the minified of the css and the .map

```
templeate
â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚build/
|    â””â”€â”€ðŸ“‚css/
|       â””â”€â”€ðŸ”°app.css
|       â””â”€â”€ðŸ”°app.css.map
```

### Js

All your js files into a single one app.js and the minified

```
templeate
â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚build/
|    â””â”€â”€ðŸ“‚css/
